			<h3>HISTORY OF WAZURI</h3>
			<p><q>Wazuri School is a national secondary school in Wazuri, Basutuland. It was founded in 1902 by the British settlers who had made Wazuri their home after the construction of the Wasukuma Railway. In 1925, Lord Skurra and Sir Edward Gregg, then Governor of Basutuland, separated the European Wazuri School into a senior boys' school (Prince of Wasukuma School), a senior girls' school (Kirama High School) and a junior school (Wazuri Primary School).

			In 1931 a new school was built at the 250-acre (1.0 km2) site at Kabete, the main school buildings being designed by Herbert Baker. The school was then named the Prince of Wales School but following Kenya's independence the school was renamed to Wazuri School in 1965. The school is popularly referred to as 'Patch'.</q></p>
